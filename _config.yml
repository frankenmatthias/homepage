  desc: "I am a postdoctoral speech scientist at Ghent University. My main research interest is the sensorimotor nature of speech production. 
  During my PhD research project at Radboud University (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), I investigated the relationship between speech perception and speech production, with a special emphasis on the role of auditory feedback in speech production. Currently, I'm investigating the snese of agency during speech production, and the role auditory feedback plays in vocal agency. I conduct my research using various techniques, including altered auditory feedback as well as neuroimaging techniques (e.g., magnetoencephalography)." # Describe yourself.
